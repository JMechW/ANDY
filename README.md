# ANDY
This is the repository of ANDY - a symbolic-numerical multi-body toolbox in MATLAB for modeling, simulation, and control. (2021/12/15)

MATLAB Version Requirement: 2017 or later. For pre-compiling, the MATLAB Coder toolbox is also required.

# Copyright and Claims

ANDY was originally created by me (Jiamin Wang) in 2018 in RMLab at Virginia Tech. The toolbox was originally open-sourced at (https://github.com/RM-Lab/ANDY). I left RMLab in Jan 2019 and has still been developing and managing the toolbox. Recently, the RM-Lab organization account has been removed along with the original repository. I was not notified with the removal of the repository.

The removal of the original open-source repository can be interpreted as RMLab being unwilling to manage ANDY. Hence, as the creator I, Jiamin Wang, claim the ownership and management of ANDY on 2021/12/15. ANDY will remain as an open-sourced toolbox for academic and commercial use. The updates of the toolbox will also be found on this repository.
